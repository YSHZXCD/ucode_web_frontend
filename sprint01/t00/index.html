    <h2 id="what_makes_a_superhero">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero is a <i>person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t</i>. So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. <b>If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero</b>.</p>
